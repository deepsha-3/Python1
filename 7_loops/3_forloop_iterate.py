# we can use for loops in different sequences such as list, tupple or string.

# list in for loop
list=(5, 67, 888, 789, 990, 0)
for a in list:
    print(a)


#string in for loop

string="LAPTOP"
for a in string:
    print(a)

#tuple in for loop 
tuple=(1,23,456,654,5,2)
for a in tuple:
    print(a)
