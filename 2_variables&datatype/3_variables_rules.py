# Rules for defining variables in a Python.

a = 2 

abc = 350

name = 405 

_name = 5

# @name = 6 this is not allowed, as @ is not a valid character for variable names.
# Rules for defining variables in Python:

'''
1. Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.

2. Variable names cannot start with a number.

3. Variable names are case-sensitive (e.g., `name` and `Name` are different variables).

4. Variable names cannot be a reserved keyword in Python (e.g., `if`, `else`, `while`, etc.).

5. Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful to improve code readability.

6. Variable names should not contain spaces; use underscores instead (e.g., `my_variable`).

7. Variable names should not start with special characters like `@`, `$`, or `%`.
